        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This Cybersecurity Awareness Platform is an educational web‑based
            project developed to help users understand common cyber threats
            and safe online practices. The platform combines theoretical
            learning with interactive simulations to improve cybersecurity
            awareness.

        <h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
        <p>
            Many cyber attacks succeed due to lack of user awareness rather
            than technical vulnerabilities. This project aims to reduce such
            risks by educating users about phishing attacks, weak passwords,
            brute force risks, and social engineering techniques.

        <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
        <p>
            All simulations in this platform are designed purely for
            educational purposes. No real cyber attacks are performed.
            No user credentials or sensitive data are stored or transmitted.
        </p>
