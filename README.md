# Cybersecurity Awareness Platform

## Project Overview
The Cybersecurity Awareness Platform is a web‑based educational project designed to help users understand common cyber threats and adopt safe online practices. The platform combines theoretical learning with interactive, ethical simulations to improve cybersecurity awareness among users.

This project focuses on human‑centric security by addressing common attack vectors such as phishing, weak passwords, brute force attacks, and social engineering.

## Objectives
- To educate users about basic cybersecurity concepts
- To demonstrate common cyber attack techniques in a safe and ethical manner
- To improve awareness about phishing, password security, and social engineering
- To provide interactive learning through simulations and quizzes
- To assess user understanding through a quiz module

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for website structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript for interactivity and simulations

---

## Ethical Considerations
- All simulations are strictly educational
- No real cyber attacks are performed
- No passwords or personal data are stored or transmitted
- All logic runs on the client side only
