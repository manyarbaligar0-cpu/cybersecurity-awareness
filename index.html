        <p>
            This Cybersecurity Awareness Platform is designed to educate users
            about common cyber threats and safe online practices. The website
            provides structured learning modules, interactive simulators, and
            assessment tools to improve cybersecurity awareness.

        <h2>Why Cybersecurity Awareness Is Important</h2>
        <p>
            Many cyber attacks succeed not because of technical weaknesses,
            but because users are unaware of common attack techniques.
            Phishing, weak passwords, and social engineering are among the
            most frequent causes of data breaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            This platform focuses on human‑centric security by teaching users
            how to recognize threats and respond correctly.
